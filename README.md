# Project Overview 
The XR DEIA project is a collection of sources, driven by XRA, to provide a central place for developers to find solutions for creating projects that represent and are accessible for all people. We were inspired by developers and XR programs to ensure that projects created for this technology reflect authentic depictions of diverse communities and access to the programs inclusive for all people. 

## Contributions Welcome
The XRDEIA Project is open source. If you know of resources that other developers could benefit from, please share them!
> [!NOTE]
>
> Submissions should preferably include a video demonstration and/or a text walk-through, so that potential users don't have to deploy a solution to understand what it does.  Suggestions will be reviewed on the basis of clarity, functionality, and usefulness.
